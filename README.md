# DSAN
Differential Sequence Array Notation<br>
A program that calculates step by step expressions of my googological notation (aka a notation that generates H.U.G.E. numbers).<br>
It's all work in progress. It can reach Epsilon-0 strenght for now.<br>
How it works:<br><br>
Expressions are in the form: [A][B][C]...[X]n where A, B, C... X are arrays and n is an integer.<br>
Arrays are in the form: a[A]b[B]c[C]...[X]x where A, B, C... X are arrays and a, b, c... x are integers. [A], [B]... are separators and a, b... are entries<br>
The rules are defined by the code.
